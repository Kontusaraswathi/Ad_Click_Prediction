# Ad_Click_Prediction
This project predicts whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on various features such as age, daily internet usage, area income, and more.
It is built using Python and Machine Learning algorithms for classification

ðŸ“œ Overview
Online advertising is one of the primary sources of revenue for many businesses.
Being able to predict whether a user will click on an ad can help companies optimize ad placement and targeting.


In this project, we:
Preprocess the dataset.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Train multiple classification models.
Evaluate and compare their performance.
Deploy the best model.


ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains user information such as:
Daily Time Spent on Site
Age
Area Income
Daily Internet Usage
Ad Topic Line
City
Male (Gender)


Clicked on Ad (Target Variable)
ðŸ“Œ Target variable: Clicked on Ad
1 â†’ User clicked on the ad
0 â†’ User did not click
